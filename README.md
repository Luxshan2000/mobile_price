# Mobile Price Prediction Demo

This is a demo of a mobile price prediction model, utilizing a dataset collected from Kaggle. The model is trained and deployed for predicting the approximate cost of mobile phones based on various features.

## Demo Page

You can access the demo page [here](https://luxshan2000.github.io/mobile_price/demo_app/demo.html).

## Features

- Predicts mobile price based on input features.
- Provides a user-friendly interface for entering input data.
- Utilizes a trained machine learning model to make predictions.

## Usage

1. Open the demo page using the provided URL.
2. Fill in the required details for the mobile phone (e.g., battery power, clock speed, camera specifications, etc.).
3. Click on the "Predict" button to see the predicted price.

## How It Works

- The frontend interface collects input data from the user.
- Upon clicking the "Predict" button, JavaScript gathers the input data and sends it to the backend server.
- The backend server, powered by Flask, receives the input data and uses a pre-trained machine learning model to make predictions.
- The predicted price is then sent back to the frontend and displayed to the user.
